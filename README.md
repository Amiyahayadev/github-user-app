# github-user-app
Welcome to the GitHub User Search Web App project! This is a simple web application that allows users to search for GitHub profiles using a username. The application fetches GitHub profile data using the GitHub API and displays it to the user.

## Features
- Search: Users can enter a GitHub username into a search form.
- Fetch Data: Upon submitting the form, the application fetches the user's GitHub profile data from the GitHub API.
- Display: The fetched profile data is displayed on a new page (user.html).
  
## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (for basic styling)
- JavaScript (for fetching data from the GitHub API and manipulating the DOM)
